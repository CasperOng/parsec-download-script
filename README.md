# Why was doot.tk removed?
doot.tk was registered with Freenom and they no longer allow new domain registrations. Since the domain is expiring on February 3, 2023, I have switched the script over to my personal domain. While this is not as short of a link, it's a good solution for now. There are no other free domain websites, so I will not be getting a shorter domain.
