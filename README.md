# Why was doot.tk removed?
doot.tk was registered with Freenom and they no longer allow new domain registrations. Since the domain is expiring on February 3, 2023, I have switched the script over to my personal domain. While this is not as short of a link, it's a good solution for now. There are no other free domain websites, so I will not be getting a shorter domain.

A benefit of the new setup is that I have set up the script to be the index.html file of the address, so you no longer need the -L as it is not a redirect.
